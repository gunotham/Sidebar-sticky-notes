## Description

Tired of juggling a separate sticky notes app every time you need to jot something down? Sticky Notes Sidebar was created to solve that exact problem. Born from a personal need for a more accessible notepad, this extension embeds a simple and persistent sticky notes panel directly into your browser's sidebar.

Now, your notes are always just one click away, no matter what you're browsing. It's the perfect place to capture quick thoughts, manage a to-do list, or save important snippets of information without interrupting your workflow.

## Features

*   **Persistent Notes:** Your notes are saved automatically and persist between browser sessions.
*   **Easy Access:** Lives in your browser's sidebar, always one click away.
*   **Resizable Panel:** Adjust the width of the notes list to your liking.
*   **Dark & Light Themes:** Automatically matches your system theme and can be toggled manually.
*   **Simple & Clean:** A minimal interface that stays out of your way.
*   **No Data Collection:** All notes are stored locally on your machine and never transmitted.
